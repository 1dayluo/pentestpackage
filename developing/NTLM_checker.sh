# Workflow:
# ask for dcenum
# check for ntlm.txt
# read NTLM hash
# check for dchash.txt
# grep for instances of ntlm.txt in dchashdump.txt
# for every instance found add to found.txt
# sort the found.txt by unique


# 
# this goes through each line in ntlm.txt and finds the FULL string from the DCHASHDUMP
# for i in $(cat 2hashes.txt); do grep `echo $i | cut -d : -f 1` dchash.txt >> found.txt; done
